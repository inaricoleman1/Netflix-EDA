# Netflix-Exploratory Data Analysis
## By Inari Coleman

Project Overview

## Background

With the major success of indie film Everything Everywhere All at Once, independent production company Astoria Films sees the opportunity to break into the larger market.Astoria Films is looking to partner with Netflix to produce multiple films and limited series for the company. 

## Goal

The goal is to help Astoria Films production company create a successful pitch to Netflix that will result in a partnership between the two companies using Netflix historical data to identify what type of content Netflix typically produces, and what factors determine the financial success of the content.

## Tasks

First I looked at the data collected from Kaggle. The data was collected by web scraping the Netflix catalog. I used this data because I needed to analyze what type of content Netflix already has in its library. Then breakdown what content Netflix puts on its platform the most, the data could be used to create a successful pitch. First thing I checked for was missing values and incorrect data. I found out I had three columns in rating with the wrong information, so I had to search the Netflix website to find the correct information and correct the mistake. 

I only focused on certain columns:
Type: This column was the identifier if a program was a movie or tv show.
Listed_in: The genre of  the movie / tv show.
Release_year: The release year of the movie/ tv show. 
Rating: TV Rating of the movie / tv show.
To start exploring this goal, I first broke down what I wanted to know from the data in three questions: 
Which genre does Netflix produce the most of?
Over the years, what has Netflix focused on  producing: Movies or TV shows?
What is Netflix's core audience? What age groups are they mainly developing content for? 

The purpose of these questions is to find out what type of content Netflix produces the most, to increase the chances of creating a successful pitch. 

##Results 

The figure below  shows that Netflix currently has more Movies in its library than TV shows, meaning that Netflix has primarily focused on Movies. The results suggest that historically, Netflix focus has been more on Movies than Tv shows. Currently Netflix has 6,131 movies in its library, compared to 2,676 Tv shows. In 2018 Netflix had 767 movies added to its library. 













In the image below, the bar chart shows that most programs in the Netflix library have a TV-MA rating which is for adults 18+. This means that Netflix focuses on mature content over any type of content. The main audience Netflix caters to is adults. 









 






In the images below, I split the genre column into two based on program type. In these two charts we can see that Tv shows & Movies that are International based are a high interest for netflix. Second we see Dramas being the second highest genre on Netflix currently. In conclusion, I find that to have a successful pitch to Netflix be should use these findings to create a Tv or show. My first suggestion would be to pitch a Movie drama based in a foreign country such as London or Japan. 


Conclusion
 
In conclusion, with this data we can conclude that the factors that could help our pitch would be to create a Movie based on international Crime Drama. Based on the research Netflix main focus is movie content and International dramas. This pitch will help create a lasting partnership between Netflix and Indie Producer Astoria Films.
